succusfully integrated server and handler with game engine
fixed chars swalling (problem in web_connector.php , substr for some reason o_O)
can run by ./main gamelets where gamelets is gamelets dir relative to main excutable
still need to fix handleclient request method from gamelet.hh
need to implement parsing functionality in request handler

Sat May  8 16:28:54 2010
integrated serevr and handler in game_engine
removed handleclient request method from gamelet api due to compilation error (something to do with string & in parameters to method)
all seemed to compile OK , need to set path to samplr_gamelet file (so) in main.cpp

fix build script to publish web contetnt to web library 

Sat Apr 24 22:43:56 2010
fixed compilation and linkage of project
Thread.cpp is compiled into object file (o) and linked seperetly into appropriate libraries
so files need to be sym-linked into usr/lib for main to run
multi-threaded server tested against php script at port 12345 succesfuly
written simple publish script to copy web files from dev directory (game_engine/web) to web server folder (currenty /opt/monkey/htdocs)

TODO
	connect handler to game engine core
	connect game engine core to loaded gamelets
	do a speed test from two phisicly remote hosts and measure round trip time for http package (RTT)
